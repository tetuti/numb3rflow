Numb3rflow presents the user with a challenge: Inputting 5 digits in a drawable canvas and making the model predict the correct number as fast as possible! The prediciton model used is based on pre-trained model from a convolutional neural network trained on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) handwritten digit dataset which is comprised of over 60 thousand handwritten digits which have been normalized to 28x28 pixels.
